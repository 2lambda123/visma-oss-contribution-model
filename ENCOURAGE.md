# How do developers benefit from participating in open source projects?

* **Practical**: Developers may find a bug or missing feature when using open source software. Reporting a problem (or fixing it) or request a feature (or implementing it) allows the developer to achieve their goal and benefits others with a similar need.
* **Professional**: OSS contributions are generally seen as a big positive sign by employers. It can be a sign of a person for whom development is not only a job, but a passion. Similarly, employers value people who are active, engaged and recognized in relevant communities. Developers are usually unable to share proprietary code they have worked on, but can instead build a public portfolio of OSS contributions to showcase their skills. Developers can also learn by receiving feedback on their code from others in the OSS community, while giving feedback on other people's code is an opportunity for developing coaching and mentoring skills.
* **Ethical**: Many developers would like to give back / pay it forward since they are benefitting from OSS themselves. This view is also often applied to companies, not just individuals.
* **Social**: Developers get to communicate and collaborate with skilled people who share some of their interests. It's fun!
