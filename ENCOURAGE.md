# Why would a developer want to contribute to OSS?

## Practical
* You are using OSS and found a bug or missing feature. You need to fix or improve it for your own purposes and might as well let other people benefit from the same work.

## Ethical
* You are using OSS and benefitting from other people's work for free and would like to give back / pay it forward

## Professional
* OSS contributions are generally seen as a big positive sign by employers. It is often a sign of a person for whom development is not only a job, but a passion.
* You are normally unable to share code you have created for private companies, but you can build a public portfolio of OSS contributions to showcase your skills
* Similarly, employers value people who are active, engaged and recognized in relevant communities
* Getting feedback on your code from new people is another opportunity for learning, while giving feedback on other people's code is an opportunity for developing those coaching and mentoring skills

## Social
* You get to collaborate with skilled people who share some of your interests
* It's fun!
